## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 14+ (local or hosted — [Supabase](https://supabase.com) works great)
- npm

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/prajitnanu/governance-os.git
cd governance-os

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Copy environment template and set your database URL
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DATABASE_URL to your PostgreSQL connection string

# 4. Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# 5. Seed demo data (entities, directors, meetings, licenses)
npm run db:seed

# 6. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002).

Authentication is **disabled by default** — you are signed in automatically as a super_admin. No Okta setup needed for local development.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | **Yes** | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `AUTH_ENABLED` | No | Set `true` to enable Okta SSO. Default: `false` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | No | Required only for Terms of Reference Stage 2 AI analysis |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | If auth enabled | Random secret — generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | If auth enabled | App base URL, e.g. `http://localhost:3000` |
| `OKTA_CLIENT_ID` | If auth enabled | Okta application client ID |

| `viewer` | Dashboard and Entities (read-only) |

---

## Terms of Reference Generator

Navigate to any entity → click **Terms of Reference**.

**Stage 1 — Template-based (no AI required)**
- Pre-fills quorum, notice period, and reserved matters from the jurisdiction's Companies Act defaults
- Generates a fully formatted Word document (.docx) with cover page, board composition table, meeting rules, statutory compliance clauses, reserved matters, and signature block

**Stage 2 — AI-assisted (requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)**
- Upload your company Constitution and/or Shareholder Agreement (PDF or DOCX)
- Claude AI extracts relevant governance clauses, identifies quorum/notice overrides, and flags conflicts between documents
- All findings are merged into the generated Word document with dedicated sections

---

## Jira Integration

Jira integration is currently unavailable and is planned for a future release. No configuration is required. The "Sync from Jira" control in the Compliance module is visible but disabled as a placeholder for this planned capability.

## Troubleshooting

**API routes unexpectedly return 404, or `/api/auth/*` returns HTML instead of JSON**

If you see errors like:

```
GET /api/auth/session 404
[next-auth][error][CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR] Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

this is caused by a stale or corrupted local Turbopack `.next` build cache, not an authentication or routing bug. Clear the cache and start a fresh dev server:

```bash
npm run dev:clean
```

This removes the local `.next` build cache and restarts `next dev`. It is **not** something you need to run routinely — only reach for it when Turbopack is behaving inconsistently (unexpected 404s, routes not picking up recent changes, etc.).
